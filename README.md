#Block API

You have blocks of various combinations of shapes, colors, and patterns.

Design and implement an API that can be used to keep track of the blocks with the ultimate goal of being able to create lists of blocks that
 have certain criteria. Using this API, you should be able to do things like get a listing of the blocks
 being tracked, get the information about a certain block, and whatever other functionality that you believe that would be
 useful for this API.

As stated above, one functionality this API must have is the ability to create a list of blocks, of a length specified, that have unique
 patterns. The API should obviously also follow good software design principles.

 When we refer to "keep track of the data," we mean keeping track of the blocks that we have. And yes, the user should be able to update
 the collection of blocks. The idea is that there may be new blocks added or removed from the collection

The ultimate goal isn't to list all the blocks per se. The goal is to have the functionality in the API where after you entered information
for all the blocks, that someone using the API should be able to get a list of blocks with unique patterns and the number of entries in
this list should be specifiable. And with regards to the characteristics of the blocks, as stated they will be in combinations of
various shapes, colors, and patterns.

So for instance, there might be a purple sphere block with a wavy line pattern on it and another block might be a blue cube block with
 a wavy line pattern, etc... So blocks may share certain characteristics.

I think there might be some slight confusion with regards to the term "track." In this case, we have a collection of physical blocks.
 These blocks have the characteristics as described (shape, color, etc...). We want to keep track of all blocks that we have.
